Dataset Overview

This project uses the Customer Analytics (E-Commerce Shipping) dataset from Kaggle, which contains transactional, customer, product, and logistics data for individual e-commerce orders. The dataset is designed to support analysis of on-time delivery performance, a critical metric for customer satisfaction and operational efficiency in large-scale e-commerce systems.
Each row represents a single customer order, with features describing customer behavior, shipping configuration, product characteristics, and promotional activity. The primary outcome variable indicates whether an order was delivered on time.

Analytical Focus
The dataset enables:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in delayed deliveries
- Feature-driven insights into how shipping mode, product weight, discounts, and customer behavior impact delivery performance
- Binary classification modeling to predict late deliveries
- Operational recommendations grounded in data

Feature Categories
- Customer Behavior: customer care calls, customer rating, prior purchases
- Shipping & Operations: shipping mode, warehouse block
- Product Attributes: product importance, product weight, product cost
- Promotions: discount offered
- Target Variable: on-time delivery indicator (Reached.on.Time_Y.N)

Why This Dataset Matters
This dataset closely mirrors real-world e-commerce logistics challenges, making it well-suited for demonstrating:
- Business-focused data storytelling
- Practical feature engineering
- Predictive modeling with operational relevance
- It provides a strong foundation for showcasing end-to-end data science skills in a portfolio setting.
