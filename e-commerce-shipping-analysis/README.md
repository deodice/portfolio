# E-Commerce Shipping Analysis

## Business Problem
Late deliveries increase customer dissatisfaction, refund requests, and operational costs.
In large-scale e-commerce operations, even small increases in delivery delays can have
significant downstream impacts on customer retention and profitability.

This analysis identifies key drivers of shipping delays and provides data-driven insights
to improve on-time delivery performance.

## Impact
The findings from this analysis can help logistics and operations teams:
- Optimize shipping mode selection
- Identify high-risk product categories
- Improve warehouse-level performance
- Reduce delivery-related customer complaints and refunds

## Dataset Overview
This project uses the **Customer Analytics (E-Commerce Shipping)** dataset from Kaggle, which
contains transactional, customer, product, and logistics data for individual e-commerce orders.
The dataset is designed to support analysis of on-time delivery performance, a critical metric
for customer satisfaction and operational efficiency in large-scale e-commerce systems.

Each row represents a single customer order, with features describing customer behavior,
shipping configuration, product characteristics, and promotional activity. The primary outcome
variable indicates whether an order was delivered on time.

## Analytical Focus
The dataset enables:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in delayed deliveries
- Feature-driven insights into how shipping mode, product weight, discounts, and customer behavior impact delivery performance
- Binary classification modeling to predict late deliveries
- Operational recommendations grounded in data

## Feature Categories
- **Customer Behavior:** customer care calls, customer rating, prior purchases  
- **Shipping & Operations:** shipping mode, warehouse block  
- **Product Attributes:** product importance, product weight, product cost  
- **Promotions:** discount offered  
- **Target Variable:** on-time delivery indicator (`Reached.on.Time_Y.N`)

## Why This Dataset Matters
This dataset closely mirrors real-world e-commerce logistics challenges, making it well-suited
for demonstrating:
- Business-focused data storytelling
- Practical feature engineering
- Predictive modeling with operational relevance
- End-to-end data science workflows suitable for production analytics teams
